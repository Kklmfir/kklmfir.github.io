Music is one of my friends :headphones: that i always play in my daily life when there is no formal activity or it is not too busy. I can easily interact with other people even in a new environtment, therefore i can easily adapt, work in a team, communicate easily, but remain thorough and professional :nerd_face:. However, i also need time to be alone so that my energy can recover after activities i do :lotus_position_man:.
